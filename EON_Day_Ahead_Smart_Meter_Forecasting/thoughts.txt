Training models:
	Some questions about the model training emerge due to the submission form, which requires a forecast based on the id of the dwelling groups.
	Each group is based on the grographical approximity.
	Based on this, is has to be considered, whether one model can provide accorate forcasts for every group or if there should be seperate a model for each group.

	Another point to be considered is the fact, that the timespans for which data should be forecasted, are in the middle of the dataset.
	So it isn't just a classical forecast but a "fill-the-gaps" task.
