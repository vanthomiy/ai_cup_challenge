    "# The Trading Hub Europe Gas Prediction Task\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Setting\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural gas has become an essential asset during the transition to renewable energies. As a commodity natural gas requires physical transport and corresponding storage facilities in order to meet the daily demands of consumers like households or industry. These demands need to be planned ahead to ensure that sufficient gas is available. In order to ensure a stable natural gas supply, the difference between input and offtake needs to be balanced on a daily basis. As the consumption of natural gas is highly variable, gas providers experience differences between the demand of gas and the amount of gas forecasted or contracted for. For Geramany, [Trading Hub Europe GmbH](https://www.tradinghub.eu/) has to account for this difference and ensure that for every day, the amount of consumed gas is equal to the amount of provided gas through buying (or selling) gas from (to) the market. Clearly balancing is associated with costs depending on the quality of the forecast of natural gas consumption and thus has an enormous optimisation potential."

    "## The Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will be provided with natural gas balancing data from Trading Hub Europe on a daily basis over a period from 2011 to 2021. The data will be organized into different folds, where the first fold consists of 150 days of training and 5 days for forecasting. Each subsequent fold will consist of 30 days for training and 5 for forecasting. For the training set, we will provide the net amount (margin) of gas bought or sold per day, aggregated for Germany. Your task will be to provide a multi-step-ahead forecast of the margin for each foreacast day.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are concerned with two evaluation measures. The first is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) across the first forecast day of each fold (i.e. the 1-day-ahead forecast error). The second is the MAE for the remaining 2-5 days. The final score to be submitted is the average of these two values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "score = \\frac{0.5}{F}\\left( \\sum_{f} |f_{f,1}-y_{f,1}|\\right) + \\frac{0.5}{4F} \\left(\\sum_{f}\\sum_{t=2}^{5}|f_{f,t}-y_{f,t}|\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{f,t}$ is your provided forecast for the $f$-th fold and $t$-th forecast day in a fold and $y_{f,t}$ is the true net amount of gas to be bought / sold for the $f$-th fold and $t$-th forecast in a fold day. $F$ is the total number of folds. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to use external data like for example weather data, but no other data from the natural gas market or future data in the provided dataset (i.e. data beyond the period you want to forecast for). \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>From 1st of October 2011 onwards we provide a full year of data. After this first 365, we provide intervals of 30 days for training and 5 days as forecasting target (see the evaluation intervalls below as well as the example submission file.).\n",
    "You are allowed to re-use past forecasts, but you are not allowed to use any future information in the data (or external) beyond the forecasting period.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phases of the Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is organised in two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> <b>Phase 1 - Model Development:</b></p> In phase 1 we provide you the training data, which you can use to develop your models. Submission to the system will be evaluated on a subset of the ground-truth and only using an unweighted mean absolute error on the forecasts. This is done in order to avoid optimization on the ground truth through repeated submissions. The number of submissions will also be limited to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Phase 2 - Evaluation:</b></p> In phase 2 we will evaluate your submissions on the true test set. You will be allowed to conduct 20 submissions, whereas the last submission will be counted as final score. "

    "# The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided in the file `train.csv` with one line of data per day, with the first line containing the header data. The following columns are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `day` day in the form YYYY-MM-DD\n",
    "- `SLP` expected consumption in natural gas networks obtained by small costumers obatined via standard profiles ([Standardlastprofile](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardlastprofil)). Unit is KWH\n",
    "- `RLM` measured consumption in natural gas for larger industries (Registrierte Leistungsmessung). Unit is KWH. Will be not available for days in the forecasting range and one day before. \n",
    "- `ENTRY` real energy (Einspeisung) provided to the network in KWH. Will be not available for days in the forecasting range and one day before. \n",
    "- `EXIT` real energy in MWH consumed (Ausspeisung) by small costumers. Will be not available for days in the forecasting range and one day before. \n",
    "- `BK-Saldo` difference in forcasted consumption from the real consumption for large consumers (mostly industries) (Bilanzkreislaufsaldo). Will be not available for days in the forecasting range.  \n",
    "- `NK-Saldo` difference in forecasting of the consumption from the real consumption for small consumer (e.g. households). Will be not available for days in the forecasting range. \n",
    "- `holiday` 1 if the day is a german holiday and 0 otherwise \n",
    "- `SystemBuy` amount of energy to be bought, Will be not available for days in the forecasting range and one day before.\n",
    "- `SystemSell` amount of energy to be sold, Will be not available for days in the forecasting range and one day before. \n",
    "- `margin` difference between energy which needed to be bought vs energy to be sold (i.e. `SystemBuy-SystemSell`). Forecasting target, which will be not available for days in the forecasting range. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that approximately `SLP+RLM+EXITSO_ALL = ENTRYSO_ALL` holds but due to the underlying physical characteristics of the network, there is no explicit relation. The acutal phyiscal energy is decoupled from the market energy and needs to be balanced on a daily basis. So `BK-Saldo` and `NK-Saldo` hint towards the daily difference in physical energy aggregated over larger consumers (e.g. industrie) and smaler consumers (e.g. households, city gas networks). Due to the different properties of the phyiscal networks (e.g. storage, size) there is no direct, explicitly expressable equation in the data for the balancing `margin` and the other variables."
